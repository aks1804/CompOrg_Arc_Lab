This is the ALU Design assignment for the MIPS and uPOWER ISA written in verilog.
The modules perform Arithmetic, Logical and Comparision operations supported by the MIPS and uPOWER ISA.
The verilog ALU module takes in the opcode, contents of the registers, shiftAmount, ALUResult and AluSrc signals
with the signed Immediate as arguments and produces output as required.
